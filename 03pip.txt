pip is performance improvment package 
use to install packages that are not download in standard distribution during installation.
pip -Version
pip install packagename
pip uninstalll packagename 
pip show packagename (for details)
pip list (to see all the downloaded packages)

pip install packagename -to install package
pip list -to view all the packages downloaded
pip list -o -to view all the outdated packages which are needed to be upgraded
pip list -U packagename -to upgrade that package which is outdated

virtualenve is a packagename used to seperate different python environmnets
for example consider some projects may be using django,flask now if you upgrade the package then it 
might break so website but if it might have issolated environment tha are only needed for that 
environment so that might be helpful
pip install virtualenv
pip list
now steps to make virtual environment:
mkdir Directoryname
cd!$ (goes to that Directory)
virtualenv projectname
source projectname/bin/activate (-now we are in new python environment)
which python (gives python path we are in)
which pip (tells the pip we are using)
pip list (when we check again we see that new env is added)
pip install packages (packages like numpy,pytz,psutil are needed to do downloaded in that new created 
environment )
pip freezee --local >> filename.txt(this allows to use gobal site packages with virtual python environment, takes only local dependencies)
cat filename.txt 
deactive (this command helps to get out of python enivronemnt, it also removes from pip list)
rm -rf projectname/

virtual -p /usr/bin/python 3.1 envname (creates new environment)
source envname/bin/activate (actives the environment)
which python
which pip
python --version
ls 
pip install packages
pip list
deactive
ls
