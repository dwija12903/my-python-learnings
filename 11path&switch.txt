-----------What is in this text document--------
to find what which python interpreted we are usung and where it is loacted onto the machine and also we 
will see how to switch b/w diffrent python verions and environments and also how to troubleshot imports 
if not working properly

python.exe file executes the python files
after setting python file location into the environment variable we can acces it any file loaction 
into cmd

pip allows us to install packages, to download packages using pip we need to go into scripts directory 
as it contains pip.exe, again after setting scripts directory onto the environment variable we can acces
it from user file location

sys module is a module in python which allows us to tell excaltly which python verision we are using,for that
import sys
sys.executable #tells directory of python
echo %path% #tells whole path of python 

of we have installed diffrent versions of python and want to change the version then we need to directly 
change from environment variable by moving thata version onto the top

pip show packagename- tells us the loaction  and details of that package 
when we have installed an package and its showing error then check weather we have installed it onto the 
proper directory

SUBLIME text
import sys
sys.excecutable
sys.version

to use diffrent version,virtual env we need to use build system to change yhings 
tools->build system->build system->gives json file
